## Random Git Pusher

Run the `xxx-bot.sh` file to generate random (0 to 9) number of git commits for the date range you pride.

### Usage

Fork the repo and open in your terminal.

1. Run the `xxx-bot.sh` file as
```bash
bash xxx-bot.sh

# or

sh xxx-bot.sh
```
2. Give start date in YYYY-MM-DD format
3. Give end date in YYYY-MM-DD format
4. Refresh to see commits

- In **Windows**, if you don't have **WSL**installed, Git folder has a `Git Bash` app from where you can run this.
- In **MacOS** use `mac-bot.sh`
- In **Linux** or **WSL** use `gnu-bot.sh`
- git sites takes a maximum of 1000 commits at a time, so it is advised to give a date range of 6 months.
